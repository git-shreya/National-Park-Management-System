# National Park Management System

## Overview
This project is a database-driven system designed to manage wildlife conservation and national park operations. It integrates a normalized MySQL database with a Django-based web application to support both visitor services and administrative workflows.

## Project Components
- Detailed ER modeling and normalization (up to 3NF)
- MySQL database with constraints, procedures, triggers, and analytical queries
- Django web application with full CRUD operations

## ER Modeling
A comprehensive ER diagram with approximately 30–35 entities was designed to model the national park ecosystem. A subset of core entities was implemented in the database to demonstrate system feasibility and real-world functionality.

## Database Implementation
- Database: MySQL
- Includes stored procedures and triggers
- Implements real-world business rules and constraints
- Supports analytical and administrative queries

## Web Application
